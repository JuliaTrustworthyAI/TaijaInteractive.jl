## Fronend Views

We have two main views accompanied by smaller additional ones. These are the pool view where the users dashboards can be found and the dashboard view where the dashboard-elements are located. Each dashboard-element gets rendered into a html-string using `Genie` then gets sent to the frontend.

There are also javascript functions accompanying the frontend these are mainly used for fetching backend routes and minor frontedn specific functionalities, such as drag&drop or searching dashboards.
